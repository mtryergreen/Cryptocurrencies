# Cryptocurrencies

# Context
An investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers. The bank is disoriented in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. 

## Objective
I've been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped and create a classification system for this new investment. 

### Task List
- I'll need to preprocess the data for PCA
- the data needs to have its data dimensions reduced using PCA
- the cryptocurrencies need to be clustered using K-means
- the cryptocurrency results should be visualized
